              <p>
                The company had a young and highly talented development team,
                but it was lacking in experience. They recognized that the team
                needed guidance to overcome the challenges they faced in a
                security-focussed environment that was more than just fast-paced
                … it was accelerating. They turned to 17 Oranges for interim
                mentorship.

              <p>
                One of our senior architects became the team’s mentor. They
                joined the team on their daily stand-ups. They spent time with
                developers individually and with the team as a whole. They
                quickly helped the team put processes in place that helped them
                spot challenges before they became fires. Ultimately, they
                helped the team build a framework for success.

              <p>The results of the mentorship were quick and far reaching:</p>

                <li>
                  The team was armed with new processes allowing them to work
                  much more efficiently, minimising reworks and bug fixes.

              <Animate>
                <li>
                  The team was able to execute their developmental roadmap on
                  time and on budget.

                  It provided a springboard for a new way of working for the
                  team that has now been adopted by the company as a whole.

              <p>
                We used our years of running large- and small-scale projects to
                help the development team increase their output, giving the
                client confidence that their technology would allow them to
                continue to grow their business.
