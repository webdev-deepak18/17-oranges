                We're already approaching the end of Q1 2023. That means
                financial year ends, new budgets, a tough economy and the rise
                of disruptive technologies. So how are you planning for the new
                financial year?

                Recruitment is, and probably has been for a few years, on the
                cusp of major changes. Obviously, the dreaded C***D turned the
                industry on its head. Companies had to adapt rapidly to the
                demand of new employees. Working from home and flexible working
                meant recruiters got caught in the middle between employees and
                employers a lot of the time. Those who successfully pivoted,
                won. Those who didn't, lost.

                Many professionals have had to, but particularly recruiters, had
                lessons to learn as well. Some will remain belligerent and
                convinced they'll be able to continue as they always have done
                (hint: they won't). Here are some of the hurdles the industry
                will need to clear as they plan for the next financial year.

                  Skills gap: There is likely to be an ongoing challenge in
                  finding candidates with the right skills for certain
                  positions, particularly in industries such as technology where
                  the pace of innovation is rapid. So, what are you going to do
                  about it? I don't think crossing your fingers will work (or
                  your toes).

                  Candidate experience: With an increasing number of job
                  opportunities available to candidates, recruiters may need to
                  focus on creating a positive candidate experience to attract
                  top talent. We're also seeing a dearth of talent as over 50s
                  leave the traditional workforce earlier due to factors
                  stemming from COVID.

                  Diversity and inclusion: As businesses become more aware of
                  the importance of diversity and inclusion, recruiters will
                  need to focus on creating strategies to attract and hire
                  diverse talent. Companies across other sectors, such as
                  finance and human resources, are already using technology and
                  education in order to both attract and retain diverse talent,
                  but also optimise training for existing teams and fight
                  unconscious biases. Are you doing the same in the recruitment
                  process?

              <Animate>

                  Technological advancements: With the rise of AI, machine
                  learning and automation, recruiters may need to adapt and
                  integrate these technologies into their hiring processes to
                  remain competitive. The rise of ChatGPT is just going to be
                  the start. It was the fastest company to hit 100 million
                  users, just two months after launch. Some of this tech in
                  still in its infancy but disregard it at your peril!

              <Animate>
                <li>
                  Retention: Once talent is hired, it is important to keep them
                  engaged and motivated to reduce the risk of turnover.
                  Recruiters may need to develop retention strategies that go
                  beyond traditional compensation and benefits packages. This is
                  more important for internal T&C professionals but now,
                  companies are hiring recruitment firms to consult on their
                  retention as well. Also, look close to home. Recruiters are
                  great at getting people jobs. That includes themselves. Think
                  about that next time you're enforcing a 5-day office week.

                These challenges are not exclusive to the next financial year
                and will probably apply for the next decade. So, think about it
                now, and future proof your business. The largest and most feared
                upcoming change to any industry, let alone recruitment, will be
                tech. Technology has already had a significant impact on the
                recruitment sector in recent years, and it is likely to continue
                to shape the industry in the coming years. Here are some
                potential ways that technology may impact recruitment:

              <Animate>
                <li>
                  Automation: Automation technology, such as applicant tracking
                  systems and chatbots, is already being used to streamline
                  recruitment processes and reduce the administrative burden on
                  recruiters. In the coming years, we may see more sophisticated
                  automation technology that can handle more complex tasks such
                  as candidate screening and interviewing.

                <li>
                  Artificial intelligence (AI): AI has the potential to
                  transform recruitment by using algorithms to match candidates
                  with job openings, predict which candidates are most likely to
                  be successful, and identify patterns in candidate data that
                  can help recruiters make better decisions. AI can also be used
                  to reduce bias in recruitment by removing human bias from the
                  process.

              <Animate>
                <li>
                  Virtual reality (VR): VR technology can be used to create
                  immersive job simulations, allowing candidates to experience
                  what it would be like to work in a particular role or
                  environment before they apply. This technology can also be
                  used to conduct remote interviews and assessments
                </li>
              </Animate>
              <Animate>
                <li>
                  Big data: The recruitment sector generates vast amounts of
                  data, from resumes and candidate profiles to interview
                  transcripts and feedback. Big data analytics can be used to
                  identify patterns and insights that can help recruiters make
                  better decisions, such as identifying the most effective
                  recruitment channels and screening criteria.
                </li>
              </Animate>
            </ul>
            <Animate>
              <p>
                Overall, technology has the potential to make recruitment
                processes more efficient, objective and effective, and improve
                the candidate experience. However, it is important to ensure
                that technology is used responsibly and ethically and does not
                perpetuate existing biases or discriminate against certain
                groups of candidates.

                This throws a lot of questions into the air about how they will
                be adapted by agencies and in-house professionals alike. Will
                some agencies go in full steam ahead with VR headsets of New
                York offices while others just make do with reaching out to
                graduates on LinkedIn?
